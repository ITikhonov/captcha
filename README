CAPTCHA library - anti-bot image generator

Small portable CAPTCHA images generator library without dependencies.

Please, note that this toy captcha is easily beaten by OCR

It generates 200x70 images in style of reCAPTCHA ones with five random
lower case letters. Instead of letter 'g' letter 'a' substituted.

Library includes GIF generation function.

Program included writes GIF image to stdout and letters generated
to stderr.

Version: 2010-08-18 (git:d67c75a)
Download: libcaptcha.c (32k)
Github: http://github.com/ITikhonov/captcha
Build: gcc -DCAPTCHA -o captcha libcaptcha.c
Usage: ./captcha captcha.gif
Example: ~/captcha$ ./captcha captcha.gif

If you want to use it as a library compile libcaptcha.o and add it
to linker:

   gcc -c libcaptcha.c gcc -o myprog myprog.o libcaptcha.o

Functions and constants exported:

const int gifsize; — makegif function will generate GIF of that size.

void captcha(unsigned char im[70*200], unsigned char l[6]); — fills
buffer: im with greyscale 1-byte pixels for 200x70 image; l with five
letters generated and trailing zero byte.

void makegif(unsigned char im[70*200], unsigned char gif[gifsize]); -
write GIF image of pixels from im to gif buffer. Image is always exactly
that gifsize (17646) bytes long.

Here is a complete example of usage:

const int gifsize;
void captcha(unsigned char im[70*200], unsigned char l[6]);
void makegif(unsigned char im[70*200], unsigned char gif[gifsize]);

int main() {
	char l[6]; unsigned char im[70*200]; unsigned char gif[gifsize];

	captcha(im,l); makegif(im,gif);

	write(1,gif,gifsize); write(2,l,5);

	return 0;
}

Compile it with:

gcc -o test test.c libcaptcha.c

Letters are generated from a sample image of free HPLHS OldStyle font
taken from dafont.com

Thanks to Martin Townsend who fixed segfaults on ARM platform due to
some chars not being int8_t's.
